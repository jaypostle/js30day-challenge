    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    // the value of age goes into the variable age 2 at the same time as declaring. So when you declared it on line 12, it was 100.
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = "Wes";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // team is a reference of the array. When you edit the original array, it will go back to the original array. 


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice;
    // This will return the entire array. If you pass it nothing it returns a copy. Then changing team 2 will not affect players array. 

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    // spread takes every item out of the iterable and puts it into the new array. 
    team4[3] = 'heee haww';

    console.log(team4);
    console.log(players);

    // this works as well
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // starts with a blank object, you pass it the object you wish to copy the properties from, and then you fold in your new properties that you wish to overwrite
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(`Captain: ${captain}, Person: ${person}`);
    console.log(captain, person);
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
